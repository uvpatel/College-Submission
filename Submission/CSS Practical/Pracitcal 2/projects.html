    <h1>About My Projects</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>I have worked on multiple projects across Python, C, and Web Development, focusing on problem-solving, game development, automation, and UI design. My projects range from interactive games to utility-based applications and web development. Below is a summary of my work:</p>
    
    <h2>üéÆ Game Development (Python & C)</h2>
    <h3>1. Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)</h3>
    <p>
        - Developed a CLI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python.<br>
        - Implemented game logic for both single-player (AI-based) and two-player mode.<br>
        - Used randomization to make the AI's moves unpredictable.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Snake Game (C)</h3>
    <p>
        - Created a classic Snake game using C.<br>
        - Used <code>graphics.h</code> for rendering (or simple text-based interface).<br>
        - Implemented collision detection and score tracking.
    </p>
    
    <h2>üåê Web Development Projects</h2>
    <h3>3. Personal Portfolio (HTML, CSS)</h3>
    <p>
        - Designed a fully responsive personal portfolio.<br>
        - Implemented modern UI design with CSS animations.<br>
        - Showcases skills, projects, and contact information.
    </p>
    
    <h3>4. Simple Music Player (HTML, CSS, JS)</h3>
    <p>
        - Built a music player with an interactive playlist.<br>
        - Used HTML5 <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag for media controls.<br>
        - Added a sound wave visualizer using <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Python Utility Projects</h2>
    <h3>5. File Organizer (Python, OS Module)</h3>
    <p>
        - Developed a file organizer that automatically categorizes files based on their extensions.<br>
        - Uses Python scripting to move files into respective folders (Documents, Images, Videos, etc.).<br>
        - Helps in keeping directories clutter-free and organized.
    </p>
    
    <p>These projects reflect my problem-solving skills, programming expertise, and passion for development. I continuously strive to improve my skills and work on more complex projects. üöÄ</p>
